# Roblox Projects
Some Roblox projects. Physics simulations, algorithm testing, and other random stuff included. Mostly old stuff but they all still work.

### FloodFill.lua
This was a small floodfill algorithm I made back in 2019. The idea was to eventually use it to create the Iron Man Nanotech suit seen in the movie Avengers Infinity War

### LavaGame.rbxl
This was a minigame I made for a friend who wanted some content for his Youtube channel. The lava rises after a player uses the /lava command and the game itself relies on remote events for player death, respawning, and lava logic.

### Orbit.rbxl
I created this simulation after a friend told me he didn't think it was possible to make multiple objects orbit eachother in-game. I used the equation for a circle to derive coordinates of the planets along their orbit. It's quite satisfying to watch the spheres orbit around eachother in a nested fashion.

### RenderV1
This script was created by me in 2018. I wanted to see if I could implement a render system to try to prevent lag caused by detailed models when they were off-screen. I was able to implement the rendering by welding a sphere to the player and using it as a sort of "view distance".

### Safehouse.rbxl
An old project where I was messing around with modeling and scripting in conjunction for this project. I wanted to re-create the safehouse seen in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. When you join the game, click the stop sign to check out the safe house yourself. Scripts themselves are local and in StarterCharacter.
